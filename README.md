# Piece of Cake

**Piece of Cake** is a fun puzzle game where your mission is to earn as many 🍪 as possible by strategically placing pieces of cake on a baking tray. Get ready to mix, bake, and challenge yourself as you collect cupcakes 🧁 and conquer the board!

## Game Overview

In **Piece of Cake**, you’ll receive random cake pieces (polynominol shapes) that you can drag, rotate, and flip. Place each piece onto the 8×8 baking tray to earn 🍪 for every cell it covers. But beware – you must avoid placing pieces off the tray, overlapping them, or covering pieces that already sport cherries!

## Game Rules

- **Cake Piece Placement:**
  Every time you drop a cake piece onto the tray, you earn one 🍪 for each tray cell it covers.

- **Cherry Challenge:**
  If you manage to completely surround a cake piece with a cherry, you unlock a special **Single Piece** that must be played immediately (or you can choose to reroll for a new piece).

- **Cupcake Power:**
  Placing a piece over 🧁 adds them to your stash.
  - You earn bonus points based on the number of 🧁 in your reserve when you surround a cherry piece.
  - You can also spend a 🧁 to reroll for a new, random cake piece.
  - At the end of the game, any leftover 🧁 add even more bonus points to your final score.

- **Filling the Tray Bonus:**
  If you manage to fill the entire baking tray, you'll score an extra bonus based on the total number of 🍪 you've collected.

## Features

- **Draggable Shapes:**
  Easily drag, rotate, and flip your cake pieces to perfectly fit them onto the board.

- **Random Piece Generation:**
  Each turn, a new random cake piece challenges your spatial skills.

- **Dynamic Scoring:**
  Earn points for placement and bonus points for surrounding cherry-topped pieces, with extra boosts from your cupcake reserve.

- **Strategic Gameplay:**
  Challenge yourself to maximize your score by balancing piece placement and resource management.

## Tech Stack
